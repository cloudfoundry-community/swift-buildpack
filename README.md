IBM Bluemix buildpack for Swift
===============================

This is the Bluemix buildpack for Swift applications, powered by the Swift Package Manager (SPM). Though this buildpack was developed mainly for Bluemix, it can be used on any Cloud Foundry environment. This buildpack requires access to the Internet for downloading and installing several system level dependencies.

Check out the [Kitura-Starter](https://github.com/IBM-Bluemix/Kitura-Starter) for a fully working example of a Kitura-based server application that can be deployed to Bluemix (or any Cloud Foundry environment).

The buildpack will detect your app as Swift if it has a `Package.swift` file in the root.

### Version installed on Bluemix

The latest version of the IBM Bluemix buildpack for Swift on Bluemix is [v2.0.1](https://github.com/IBM-Swift/swift-buildpack/releases/tag/2.0.1).

Please note that it is possible that the latest buildpack code contained in this repo hasn't yet been installed on Bluemix. If that happens to be the case and you'd like to leverage the latest buildpack code, you can do so by adding the `-b https://github.com/IBM-Swift/swift-buildpack` parameter to the `cf push` command, as shown below:

```shell
cf push -b https://github.com/IBM-Swift/swift-buildpack
```

### Procfile

Using the `Procfile`, you specify the name of the executable process (e.g. `Server`) to run for your web server. Any binaries built from your Swift source using SPM will be placed in your $PATH. You can also specify any runtime parameters for your process in the `Procfile`.

```
web: Server --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT
```

### Alternative to Procfile

Instead of using the `Procfile`, you can use the `command` attribute in the `manifest.yml` of your application to specify the name of your executable. The snippet of code below shows how to use the `command` attribute to specify the same executable and parameter values used in the above `Procfile` example:

```
command: Server -bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT
```

For further details on the `command` attribute, see the [command attribute section](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/manifest.html#start-commands) on the Cloud Foundry documentation.

### Swift-cfenv

Instead of specifying IP address and port values in the `Procfile` (or in the `command` attribute) as runtime parameters to your web server process, you can instead use the [Swift-cfenv](https://github.com/IBM-Swift/Swift-cfenv) package to obtain such values at runtime. The Swift-cfenv package provides structures and methods to parse Cloud Foundry-provided environment variables, such as the port number, IP address, and URL of the application. It also provides default values when running the application locally. For details on how to leverage this library in your Swift application, see the [README](https://github.com/IBM-Swift/Swift-cfenv) file. When using Swift-cfenv in your app, your `Procfile` will be very simple; it will more than likely look like this:

```
web: <executable_name>
```

If instead of the `Procfile`, you are using the `command` attribute in your application's `manifest.yml` file, then the entry for the `command` attribute is simplified to:

```
command: <executable_name>
```

### What is the latest version of Swift supported?

The latest version of Swift supported by this buildpack is ```3.0```.

### Specify a Swift version

You specify the version of Swift for your application using a `.swift-version` file in the root of your repository:

```shell
$ cat .swift-version
3.0
```

Please note that the swift_buildpack installed on Bluemix **caches** the following versions of the Swift binaries:

- `3.0`

If you'd like to use a different version of Swift [that is not cached] on Bluemix, you can specify it in the `.swift-version` file.  Please be aware that using a Swift version that is not cached increases the provisioning time of your app on Bluemix.

The [manifest.yml](https://github.com/IBM-Swift/swift-buildpack/blob/develop/manifest.yml) file contains the complete list of the Swift versions that are cached on Bluemix.

Since there are frequent Swift language changes, it's advised that you pin your application to a specific Swift version. Once you have tested and migrated your code to a newer version of Swift, you can then update the `.swift-version` file with the appropriate Swift version.

### Installing additional system level dependencies
Many Swift applications will not require the installation of any additional libraries. It's very common for today’s applications to have dependencies only on services that provide REST interfaces to interact with them (e.g., Cloudant, AlchemyAPI, Personality Insights, etc.).

However, since dependencies vary from application to application, there could be cases when additional system packages may be required to compile and/or execute a Swift application. To address this need, the IBM Bluemix buildpack for Swift supports the installation of Ubuntu trusty packages using the `apt-get` utility. You can specify the Ubuntu packages that the should be installed by including an `Aptfile` in the root directory of your Swift application. Each line in the Aptfile should contain a valid Ubuntu package name. For instance, if your application has a dependency on the `libmysqlclient-dev` package, then your Aptfile should look like this:

```shell
$ cat Aptfile
libmysqlclient-dev
```

### Additional compiler flags

To specify additional compiler flags for the execution of the `swift build` command, you can include a `.swift-build-options-linux` file. For example, in order to leverage the system package `libmysqlclient-dev` in a Swift application, you'd need an additional compiler flag:

```shell
$ cat .swift-build-options-linux
-Xswiftc -DNOJSON
```

### System level libraries

This buildpack installs the following Ubuntu 14.04 system libraries:

- libicu-dev
- libcurl4-openssl-dev

### libdispatch

Previous versions of this buildpack provided the [libdispatch](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-libdispatch) binaries for Swift development builds **prior** to 2016-08-23. However, current and future versions of this buildpack will **not** provide those binaries. Users should upgrade their applications to Swift 3.0, which already includes the libdispatch binaries.

### Caching of the Packages folder

You should know the Bluemix buildpack for Swift will cache the contents of the `Packages` folder to speed up the provisioning of your application the next time you execute the `cf push` command. If you'd prefer not to use this caching mechanism, you can disable it by executing the following command:

```shell
cf set-env <app_name> SWIFT_PACKAGES_CACHE false
cf restage <app_name>
```

If at some point, you'd like to re-enable caching of the `Packages` folder, you can do so by executing:

```shell
cf set-env <app_name> SWIFT_PACKAGES_CACHE true
cf restage <app_name>
```

Note that if at some point you change the contents of your `Package.swift` file, the buildpack will automatically refetch the dependencies and update the cache accordingly.

### Debugging

If the buildpack preparation or compilation steps are failing, you can enable some debugging using the following command:

```shell
cf set-env <app_name> BP_DEBUG true
```

To deactivate:

```shell
cf unset-env <app_name> BP_DEBUG
```
